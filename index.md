## Overview

Conversational agents are increasingly becoming part of our day-to-day life on the phone, in the car and in the living room, performing tasks on our behalf which often require interfacing with various forms of structured knowledge. The goal of this workshop is to shed light and encourage interdisciplinary research on some of the open problems situated on the interface of dialog systems and structured knowledge (e.g., knowledge bases, tables etc.), which is critical to the development of digital assistants like Google Home, Alexa and Siri. Our hope is to help bridge the gap between academic and industry research in this area. Open questions include, but are not limited to: 
- How to enable more natural conversations about structured objects and their properties? 
- How to model the structured context of a conversation? 
- Can we develop dialog systems that can inter-operate across arbitrary knowledge base schemas? 
- How to reason about, model, and make updates to an evolving world / knowledge base in a conversational setting? 
- How to characterize and respond to ambiguous references to entities? 
- How to address acoustic ambiguity in references to KB items in spoken queries? 
- How to segment user speech into meaningful utterances? 
- How do Conversational Agents interact with a Situated KB (e.g., user devices)? 
- How to use knowledge encoded in Pre-trained LMs in Conversational Agents?
